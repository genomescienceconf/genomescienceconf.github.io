## Conference

Genome Science 2019 will take place in the [John McIntyre Conference Centre](https://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/venues/john-mcintyre-conference-centre/), situated within Pollock Halls, a University Campus in the South of Edinburgh.

Overlooked by the [Salisbury Crags](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/holyrood-park-salisbury-crags-arthurs-seat), Pollock Halls is 2 minutes walk away from [Holyrood park](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/holyrood-park-salisbury-crags-arthurs-seat), home to [Holyrood Palace](https://www.rct.uk/visit/palace-of-holyroodhouse) and the world famous [Arthur's seat](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/holyrood-park-and-arthurs-seat-p914341).

The historic city centre of Edinburgh is a mere 20 minute walk or 10 minute bus ride away, with hundreds of restaurants and bars, historic buildings and streets, award-winning whisky and traditional live Scottish music.

Campus accomodation is available through Edinburgh First at a discount rate, and [a number of hotels are within walking distance](https://goo.gl/maps/rzoc6vJ36oS2)
