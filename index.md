In 2019, Genome Science will be held in the historic and beautiful city of Edinburgh.  The conference continues to attract more than 250 delegates from academia, healthcare and industry with a focus on genomic technologies and genome science.

This year the conference will again bring together scientists from around the world and from all backgrounds to share ideas, innovations and advances in the rapidly evolving field of high throughput sequencing technologies and -omics data analysis.

Check our our [programme](programme.md) or list of [keynote speakers](keynotes.md), read about the [venue and accomodation](venue.md); if you are a company or genomics core, check our our [sponsorship opportunities](sponsors.md); and most of all, we welcome you to [register](register.md) for the conference.

The meeting will also create a relaxed and friendly networking environment where delegates can share concerns and difficulties that can arise from such complex experiments and data analysis, but also discuss the exciting opportunities and scientific rewards that drive our interest in this field.
