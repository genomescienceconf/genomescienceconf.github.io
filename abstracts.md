# Genome Science 2019

Abstracts are invited for both talks and posters - or both! Please choose your [preferred session](http://genomescience.co.uk/programme/).

# [submit abstract](https://genome2019.exordo.com)

Our intention is to accept all abstracts for either a talk or a poster, though if we are inundated then we might not be able to.

We look forward to hearing from you!
